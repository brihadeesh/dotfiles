# Default config for tofi
#
# Copy this file to ~/.config/tofi/config and get customising!
#
# A complete reference of available options can be found in `man 5 tofi`.

#
### Fonts
#
	# Font to use, either a path to a font file or a name.
	#
	# If a path is given, tofi will startup much quicker, but any
	# characters not in the chosen font will fail to render.
	#
	# Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.
	font = "/home/peregrinator/.fonts/truetype/TerminusTTF-4.49.1.ttf"

	# Point size of text.
	font-size = 12

	# Comma separated list of OpenType font feature settings to apply,
	# if supported by the chosen font. The format is similar to the CSS
	# "font-feature-settings" property.
	#
	# Examples:
	#
	# font-features = "smcp, c2sc" (all small caps)
	# font-features = "liga 0" (disable ligatures)
	# font-features = ""

	# Comma separated list of OpenType font variation settings to apply
	# to variable fonts. The format is similar to the CSS
	# "font-variation-settings" property.
	#
	# Examples:
	#
	# font-variations = "wght 900" (Extra bold)
	# font-variations = "wdth 25, slnt -10" (Narrow and slanted)
	# font-variations = ""

	# Perform font hinting. Only applies when a path to a font has been
	# specified via `font`. Disabling font hinting speeds up text
	# rendering appreciably, but will likely look poor at small font pixel
	# sizes.
	hint-font = true

#
### Text theming
#
width = 100%
height = 100%
border-width = 0
outline-width = 0
padding-left = 35%
padding-top = 35%
result-spacing = 5
num-results = 10
background-color = #191922e6
selection-color = #66cc99

#
### Behaviour
#
	# Hide the mouse cursor.
	hide-cursor = false

	# Show a text cursor in the input field.
	text-cursor = true

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# Specify an alternate file to read and store history information
	# from / to. This shouldn't normally be needed, and is intended to
	# facilitate the creation of custom modes.
	# history-file = /path/to/histfile

	# Select the matching algorithm used. If normal, substring matching is
	# used, weighted to favour matches closer to the beginning of the
	# string. If prefix, only substrings at the beginning of the string are
	# matched. If fuzzy, searching is performed via a simple fuzzy matching
	# algorithm.
	#
	# Supported values: normal, prefix, fuzzy
	matching-algorithm = fuzzy

	# If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
	# making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
	# In drun mode, this is always true.
	require-match = false

	# If true, automatically accept a result if it is the only one
	# remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
	# skipped altogether.
	auto-accept-single = false

	# If true, typed input will be hidden, and what is displayed (if
	# anything) is determined by the hidden-character option.
	hide-input = false

	# Replace displayed input characters with a character. If the empty
	# string is given, input will be completely hidden.
	# This option only has an effect when hide-input is set to true.
	hidden-character = "*"

	# If true, use physical keys for shortcuts, regardless of the current
	# keyboard layout. If false, use the current layout's keys.
	physical-keybindings = true

	# Instead of printing the selected entry, print the 1-based index of
	# the selection. This option has no effect in run or drun mode. If
	# require-match is set to false, non-matching input will still result
	# in the input being printed.
	print-index = false

	# If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
	# Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
	drun-launch = false

	# The terminal to run terminal programs in when in drun mode.
	# This option has no effect if drun-launch is set to true.
	# Defaults to the value of the TERMINAL environment variable.
	# terminal = foot

	# Delay keyboard initialisation until after the first draw to screen.
	# This option is experimental, and will cause tofi to miss keypresses
	# for a short time after launch. The only reason to use this option is
	# performance on slow systems.
	late-keyboard-init = false

	# If true, allow multiple simultaneous processes.
	# If false, create a lock file on startup to prevent multiple instances
	# from running simultaneously.
	multi-instance = false

	# Assume input is plain ASCII, and disable some Unicode handling
	# functions. This is faster, but means e.g. a search for "e" will not
	# match "Ã©".
	ascii-input = false

### Inclusion
#
	# Configs can be split between multiple files, and then included
	# within each other.
	# include = /path/to/config
