# Dotfiles to my Void Linux system

This is a backup of my dotfiles and I **don't** update this very
regularly. I'll add more information about the setup when I find time.

## Copying

I wouldn't recommend cloning this directly. Perhaps go through the
entire file if you want to copy the whole thing but I'd personally
suggest picking out portions relevant to you and copying them. There
is also a lot of unused clutter that I haven't gotten down to cleaning
up.
